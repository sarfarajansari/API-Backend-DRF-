This repository serves as a shared Django REST Framework (DRF) backend for three applications:
1. **[Todo App](https://github.com/sarfarajansari/todo)** - A basic task management system.
2. **[Marvelous Ludo](https://github.com/sarfarajansari/ludo)** - A Marvel-themed Ludo game.
3. **[The Awesome Store](https://github.com/sarfarajansari/Ecommerce)** - An ecommerce platform with essential shopping functionalities.

This backend provides APIs for handling tasks, game logic, and ecommerce functionalities, all in a single Django project.
